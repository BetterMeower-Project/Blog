Merry Christmas everyone! We're celebrating not only Christmas, but also 3 months of BetterMeower! As a limited edition change, you can get our BetterMeower PFPs now with a cool Christmas hat! Make sure you set one quick, because they'll be leaving **January 2nd 2023**! Once again, have a merry Christmas and happy new year!
