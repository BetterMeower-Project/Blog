First of all, let's start off with **HAPPY NEW YEAR EVERYONE!!!** Let's hope 2023 is a great year!

But yes, going back to the main topic, BetterMeower is currently undergoing a rewrite. While most things will end up as they were, some features may be missing. The reason we are rewriting is due to a codebase issue making it near impossible without extreme dedication and someone who understands git better to update to the Svelte 1.5 base.

The rewrite will take multiple weeks, possibly months, but for now, BetterMeower won't be getting any changes. We'll post updates in the comments.
