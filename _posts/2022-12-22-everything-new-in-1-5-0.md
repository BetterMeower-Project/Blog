Meet our new PFPs, Abstractimates! With BetterMeower 1.5.0, you'll start seeing these popup everywhere! Don't question the names though, seriously.

## Add to chat, right from a profile
Now, with BetterMeower 1.5.0, you can add people to a group chat directly from their profile! All you have to do is click the "Add to Chat" button, and select a group chat! Simple.

## Ping notifications
Ever had someone ping you, but found out 30 minutes later when they're offline? Now you can say goodbye to that forever! Ping notifications automattically play a sound whenever someone mentions you in a message!
Don't want them enabled? You can turn them off in settings at any time!

## Log out everywhere
Our next feature is a security feature! If you log in somewhere, but forget to log out, you can log all devices out of your account with the Log out everywhere button in settings.

## But where's the log out button?
The logout button has moved to settings to help remove clutter from the sidebar (or top bar in old layout).

## New redesign!!!
Yep! We redesigned BetterMeower, by taking our existing design, and refinining it. Now, you'll see round corners on everything, as well as the home page being rearranged a bit!

## Images???????
Of course, yes, we added images, so now you can share that funny meme you found on Tenor without having to get them to open the link.
Just send a message in this format, `[400.png: https://http.meower.org/400.png]`, replacing the link with the link to your image, and the image name with whatever you want + the file extension.

## I want more!!!
Feel like breaking something? Shift-click the Settings icon to open *Developer Tools*. From there, you can do a whole bunch of cool things! Don't ask why the title is Developer Settings, I didn't do that.
