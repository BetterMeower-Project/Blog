title: "An update on the BetterMeower rewrite"

First of all, thanks for taking the time to read this blog post, instead of complaining on Meower about BetterMeower being down. As you may have seen on our website or blog, BetterMeower is currently undergoing a rewrite.
This rewrite has been stopped until the CL4 port of Meower Svelte is finished. That way, we will not have to do 2 rewrites.

I'd like to thank you for your patience, and feel free to ask any questions in the comments below.
